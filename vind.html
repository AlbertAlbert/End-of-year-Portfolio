    <p>According to its website, Vindinium is an Artificial Intelligence Programming Challenge. Each player programs their own bot. Which will fight other AI for a number of turns. The bot that was accumulated the most gold during those turns wins. Bots gain gold by taking mines, mines generate gold over time. When bots are killed by other bots, the killer takes the mines.

    <div id="Bot">
        <h1 id="Vind">My Bot</h1>
        <p>I used javascript to program my bot. My bot goes through a set of commands and selects the appropriate one based on its health, enemies health, and the available mines on the field. The bots utmost priority to stay healthy so when my bot is under 45 health it will head towards a tavern. If it has over 45 health than it will try to take free mines. If all the mines on the field are taken and my bot has over 75 health it will attack the lowest health bot on the field. If it has less than 75 health, more than 45 health, and there are no free mines on the field, then my bot will begin to take enemy mines. </p>
